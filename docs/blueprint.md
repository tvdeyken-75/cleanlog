# **App Name**: CleanLog

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: User authentication with login/logout functionality using username and password.
- Protocol Creation: Create a new cleaning protocol with fields for vehicle data (license plates), cleaning details, quality control, environmental data (GPS location, date, time, water temperature, water quality), and contamination reports.
- License Plate Autocomplete: Auto-completion of LKW-Kennzeichen (license plate) and Anh√§nger-Kennzeichen (trailer plate) fields based on previously entered data, leveraging a tool to learn the user's habits.
- Conditional Fields: Conditional display of 'Meldung Kontamination' (contamination report) fields based on the 'Ergebnis der Kontrolle' (inspection result).
- Environmental Data Capture: Record GPS coordinates, date, and time automatically when a protocol is started, with manual override option for location.
- Data Persistence: Store protocols and user credentials using local storage and a simple, file-based system, so there is no need for a database.
- Driver Dashboard: Driver dashboard displaying a summary of recent protocols.
